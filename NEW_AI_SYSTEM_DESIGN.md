# New AI System Design - Intuitive & Perfect

## Overview

Redesigned the AI experience from a tacky chat interface to an invisible, intelligent system that feels natural and intuitive.

## Core Philosophy

**"Invisible AI, Visible Results"**

The AI works in the background, not as a chatbot character. Users get intelligent results without feeling like they're talking to a robot.
