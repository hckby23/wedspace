## 🚨 Push Conflict Detected

The remote repository has existing content. Choose one option:

### Option 1: Merge Strategy (Keep Both)
```bash
# Pull and merge existing content
git pull origin main --rebase

# Resolve any conflicts if they occur
# Then push
git push origin main
```

**Use when**: You want to preserve any existing work in the GitHub repo

### Option 2: Replace Strategy (Fresh Start) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
```bash
# Force push to replace everything
git push -f origin main
```

**Use when**: 
- This is your new MVP that should replace old content
- You want a clean slate
- Old content is backed up elsewhere

4. Comprehensive documentation included
